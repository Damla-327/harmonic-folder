<section>Main Theme:
  This site will highlight the obvious blemish and concolence of reality, in a way that will gamify materiality in a purely 
  expressive and child-like way. In the hopes of indicating the paradox and the chaotic complexities of life, I will try to 
  coin to venture etherealness and whimsicality into the gates of retro illustrations, acid posters, retro, anti-design, 90 
  nostalgia, and frasurbane art. This magazine site will contain visuals of mostly digital collage-like designs for the reason 
  and demand of real touch. It will always have contrasting colors, sharp graphics, and static typographic layouts to give the 
  site movements and dimensions. Artists have used mirrors to look outward, symbolizing sight and truth. Early modern 
  personifications of truth often incorporated mirrors and scales. Initially, this magazine will serve as an act of 
  mirroring to viewers. 

This digital collage was inspired by my awareness of fabric waste. This hugely problematic issue that is not being discussed, 
contains momentous recollections for me. It surrounded around the keywords; "eye" in reclamation to my design, and the momentum 
of circles. Fashion is supposed to be a place that could always be re-used. The expression “re-circling” pinned the notion of 
circular motions that I used in my design. The description and symbolism behind the circles are considered a symbol of unity. 
It is also an indication that represents a way of infinity, without beginning or end, the ultimate geometric symbol. A circle's 
never-ending fate of loop promises an eternal return for its known story of unity. story of re-cycling, coming back to its original 
purpose. The preparation of the eye symbol demands looking at the truth. Suggestions of learning and conducting solutions.
The reason my designs have such a graphic and fun tone is to gamify the seriousness and the greatness of this blemish 
concerning nature. I tried to indicate these values, with the conjunction of fused colors from the relation and regions 
that give a base to flat and angular surfaces with unconstructive structures by the use of ripped papers from old magazines. 
I tried to reveal the relations between papers and digital positioning, inorder to bring the effort of existence together at 
a literary point.
