    <section>Main Theme: This site will highlight the obvious blemish and concolence of reality, in a way that will
      gamify
      materiality in a purely expressive and child-like way. In the hopes of indicating the paradox and the chaotic
      complexities
      of life, I will try to coin to venture etherealness and whimsicality into the gates of retro illustrations, acid
      posters,
      retro, anti-design, 90 nostalgia, and frasurbane art. This magazine site will contain visuals of mostly digital
      collage-like
      designs for the reason and demand of real touch. It will always have contrasting colors, sharp graphics, and
      static typographic
      layouts to give the site movements and dimensions. Artists have used mirrors to look outward, symbolizing sight
      and truth.
      Early modern personifications of truth often incorporated mirrors and scales. Initially, this magazine will serve
      as an act
      of mirroring to viewers.

      The complexities of life as stated before are divided into two gerenal groups; one as wastfull habits as for the
      second one
      it sheds light on the presence of nature and the sipirituality it holds.
      In the wastfull habits section, I moved from the example of fabric waste and made multiple versions to indicate
      its rapid
      negativity on the planet. In the sipurituality of nature section, where I wanted shed light on the effort to
      reflect the
      continous and eternal growth of nature. This site is more of an artsy site rather than educational, so diverse and
      different
      perspectives and opinions will always be supported with the designs interprated. The reason my designs have such a
      graphic and
      fun tone is to gamify the seriousness and the greatness of this blemish concerning nature. I tried to indicate
      these values,
      with the conjunction of fused colors from the relation and regions that give a base to flat and angular surfaces
      with
      unconstructive structures by the use of ripped papers from old magazines. I tried to reveal the relations between
      papers
      and digital positioning, inorder to bring the effort of existence together at a literary point.
